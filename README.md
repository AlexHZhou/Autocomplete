About this program:
Programmed as a for fun personal project last year. The idea came from a history paper in which 
I kept mispelling "Khruschev" so I thought, it'd be nice to have a application to finish words. 
Only uploading recently because I know how to use git now and was looking through old projects.

Purpose:
Completes words that you have partially typed, using a dictionary of words that the user 
has previously typed (does not draw from the full English dictionary).

Currently being made:
Custom commands to gain more control and usage, such as end program, stop/resume program, and custom copy paste.

Final thoughts about program:
Has very limited utility, because a suprisingly amount of applications already have some sort of
autocomplete; search engines, programming IDE's, etc. all already have autocomplete a the minimum,
and many have phrase complete. So sadly, not a ton of utility.

However, this program got me thinking about how loose security is. With some simple modifications, you
could track every single keystroke and mouse movement of the user. Starting the program does not give
a notification or request any permissions, so there could be a ton of malicious uses.
